Version: 29-09-2003

Release 0.0.2 on 29-09-2003.

Version: 26-09-2003
Notes:
- Added a context menu entry named "Find Bugs" to the context menu of the
  project. Upon activation, the whole project will be scanned.

Version: 24-09-2003
Notes:
- Project will be fully scanned when the plug-in is activated.
- Our markers will be removed if the plug-in is disabled.
- The problem marker has a more friendly name ("FindBugs Problem") and is no
  longer a subordinate of the Java problem marker.

Version: 26-08-2003
Notes:
 - As of today, the core findbugs files are located in the plug-in "edu.umd.cs.findbugs",
   from where they are referenced by our plug-in de.tobject.findbugs.

Version: 25-08-2003
Notes:
 - The markers will now also show up in the overview ruler.
 - Currently, it is not possible to put the core findbugs files into a separate
   plug-in. Reason: in FindBugsBuilder.getPlugInLocation, we get the plug-in
   location. This currently works only for the plug-in we're living in.
 - Tracing support implemented according to Eclipse guidelines. Tracing of the
   plug-in can now be turned on and off on the "Run as..." dialog.
