Adding Detectors to FindBugs
May 6, 2003

===============
1. Introduction
===============

FindBugs will move to a plugin-based approach to adding detectors.
This will make it easy for users to add their own detectors alongside
the ones that come built in.

Basic idea: FindBugs has some Jar files in a "plugins" directory.
At startup, each of those jar files is checked for a "findbugs.xml"
file.  That XML file registers instances of Detectors, as well
as particular "bug patterns" that the detector reports.

At startup, FindBugs loads all plugin Jar files.  At analysis time,
all detectors named in the findbugs.xml files from those plugins
are instantiated and applied to analyzed class files.

In order to format reported BugInstances as text for display,
a messages file is loaded from the plugin.  In order to support multiple
language translations, a locale search is performed in a manner
similar to the handling of resource bundles.  For example, if the
locale is "pt_BR", then the files

  messages_pt_BR.xml
  messages_pt.xml
  messages.xml

are tried, in that order.

2. Example findbugs.xml file
============================

<DetectorPlugin>

  <Detector class="org.foobar.findbugs.FindUnreleasedLocks" />
  <Detector class="org.foobar.findbugs.ExperimentalDetector" disabled="true" />

  <!-- More Detector elements would go here... -->

  <BugPattern type="UBL_UNRELEASED_LOCK" abbrev="UL" category="MT_CORRECTNESS" />

  <!-- More BugPattern elements would go here... -->

</DetectorPlugin>


======================================
3. Meaning of elements in findbugs.xml
======================================

  <DetectorPlugin> a collection of <Detector> and <BugPattern> elements.
  Each plugin Jar file can (and usually will) provide multiple detectors
  and define multiple bug patterns.

  <Detector> specifies a class which implements the edu.umd.cs.findbugs.Detector
  interface and has a constructor that takes a single parameter of type
  edu.umd.cs.findbugs.BugReporter.  The optional "disabled" attribute, if
  set to "true", means that the detector will not be used at runtime.
  This is useful for detectors that aren't quite ready for prime time.

  <BugPattern> specifies a kind of bug that will be reported.
  It has three required attributes:

    1. "type" is a unique code identifying the bug.  Only one BugPattern
       can have a a particular type.

    2. "abbrev" is a short alphanumeric code for the bug.
       Note that multiple BugPatterns can use the same abbreviation
       if they are related.

    3. "category" is one of the following:

       CORRECTNESS - general correctness issues
       MT_CORRECTNESS - multithreaded correctness issues
       MALICIOUS_CODE - a potential vulnerability if exposed to malicious code
       PERFORMANCE - a performance issue


============================
4. Example messages.xml file
============================

<MessageCollection>

  <BugPattern type="UBL_UNRELEASED_LOCK">
    <ShortDescription>Lock not released on all paths out of method</ShortDescription>

    <LongDescription>{1} does not release lock on all paths out of method</LongDescription>

    <Details>
    A JSR-166 lock acquired in this method is not released on all paths
    out of the method. This could result in a deadlock if another thread
    tries to acquire the lock.  Generally, you should use a finally
    block to ensure that acquired locks are always released.
    </Details>
  </BugPattern>

    <!-- More BugPattern nodes would go here... -->

</MessageCollection>


======================================
5. Meaning of elements in messages.xml
======================================

  <MessageCollection> is the top level element

  <BugPattern> holds all of the human-readable messages for the bug pattern
  identified by the "type" attribute.  The type corresponds to the
  type attribute of the BugPattern elements described in findbugs.xml.

  <ShortDescription> this is used for when "View:Full Descriptions"
  is turned off in the GUI, and it's also used as the title for 
  descriptions in the Details window.

  <LongDescription> this is used for when "View:Full Descriptions"
  is turned on in the GUI, and for output using the command line UI.
  The placeholders in the long description ({0}, {1}, etc.)
  refer to BugAnnotations attached to the BugInstances reported by
  the detector for this bug pattern.

  <Details> this is the descriptive text to be used in the Details
  window.  Note that HTML metacharacters '&', '<', and '>'
  should be escaped as '&amp;', '&lt;', and '&gt;' respectively,
  because we don't want XML to interpret the HTML tags.
