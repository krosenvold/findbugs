<h1>FindBugs Changes</h1>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.1:
<ul>
<li> Fixed a large number of bugs in the BCEL Repository and FindBugs's use
     of the Repository.&nbsp; With these changes, FindBugs should <em>never</em>
     crash or otherwise misbehave because of Repository lookup failures.&nbsp;
     Because of these changes, you must use a modified version of <code>bcel.jar</code>
     with FindBugs.&nbsp; This jar file is included in the FindBugs 0.5.2
     binary release.&nbsp; A complete patch containing the 
     <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/bugs/bcel-30-April-2003.patch"
     >modifications against the BCEL CVS main branch as of April 30, 2003</a>
     is also available.
<li> Implemented the "auxiliary classpath entry list".&nbsp; Aux classpath entries
     can be added to a project to provide classes that are referenced by the
     analyzed application, but should not themselves be analyzed.&nbsp; Having
     all referenced classes available allows FindBugs to produce more
     accurate results.
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.0:
<ul>
<li> Many user interface bugs have been fixed.
<li> Upgraded to a recent CVS version of BCEL, with some bug fixes.&nbsp;
This should prevent FindBugs from crashing when there is a failure to find
a class on the classpath.
<li> Added support for Plastic look and feel from <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/">jgoodies.com</a>.
<li> Major overhaul of infrastructure for doing dataflow analysis.
</ul>
