<h1>FindBugs Changes</h1>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.0:
<ul>
<li> Many user interface bugs have been fixed.
<li> Upgraded to a recent CVS version of BCEL, with some bug fixes.&nbsp;
This should prevent FindBugs from crashing when there is a failure to find
a class on the classpath.
<li> Added support for Plastic look and feel from <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/">jgoodies.com</a>.
<li> Major overhaul of infrastructure for doing dataflow analysis.
</ul>
