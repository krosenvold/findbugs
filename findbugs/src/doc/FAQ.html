<h1>FindBugs FAQ</h1>

<p> This document contains answers to frequently asked questions about
<a href="index.html">FindBugs</a>, a bug pattern detector for Java.

<h2>Q1: I'm getting java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError when I try to run FindBugs</h2>

<p> FindBugs requires JRE 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; If you use an earlier version,
you will see an exception error message similar to the following:
<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
edu/umd/cs/findbugs/gui/FindBugsFrame (Unsupported major.minor version 48.0)
</pre>
The solution is to upgrade to JRE 1.4.0 or later.

<h2>Q2: When I click the "Find Bugs!" button, I get a NoSuchMethodError</h2>

<p> The symptom of this bug is that when you start the FindBugs analysis,
you see an exception similar to the following:
<pre>
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.bcel.Repository.setRepository(Lorg/apache/bcel/util/Repository;)V
        at edu.umd.cs.findbugs.FindBugs.clearRepository(FindBugs.java:483)
        ...
</pre>
The problem here is that the wrong version of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">Apache BCEL</a>
library is being found.&nbsp; The probable cause is that you have installed libraries from
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html">Java(TM) Web Services Developer Pack 1.2</a>
in the <code>lib/endorsed</code> directory of your Java Runtime Environment (JRE).&nbsp;
The file <code>xsltc.jar</code> contains an old version of BCEL that is incompatible with
FindBugs.

<p> Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to this problem, because files in the
<code>lib/endorsed</code> directory take precedence over those those in the
application's CLASSPATH.&nbsp; Therefore, FindBugs will not worked with these
Jar files installed in this way.&nbsp; A workaround is to move these Jar files
into a different directory, and use the <code>java.endorsed.dirs</code> system
property to specify the new location for programs that require these files.

<p> Many thanks to Peter Meulmeester for tracking down the cause of this problem.
