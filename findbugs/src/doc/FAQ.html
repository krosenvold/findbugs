<h1>FindBugs FAQ</h1>

<p> This document contains answers to frequently asked questions about
<a href="index.html">FindBugs</a>, a bug pattern detector for Java.

<h2><a name="q1">Q1: I'm getting java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError when I try to run FindBugs</a></h2>

<p> FindBugs requires JRE 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; If you use an earlier version,
you will see an exception error message similar to the following:
<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
edu/umd/cs/findbugs/gui/FindBugsFrame (Unsupported major.minor version 48.0)
</pre>
The solution is to upgrade to JRE 1.4.0 or later.

<h2><a name="q2">Q2: When I click the "Find Bugs!" button, I get a NoSuchMethodError</a></h2>

<p> The symptom of this bug is that when you start the FindBugs analysis,
you see an exception similar to the following:
<pre>
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.bcel.Repository.setRepository(Lorg/apache/bcel/util/Repository;)V
        at edu.umd.cs.findbugs.FindBugs.clearRepository(FindBugs.java:483)
        ...
</pre>

<p> The problem here is that the wrong version of the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">Apache BCEL</a>
library is being found.&nbsp;
There are (at least) two possible reasons this is happening.

<p> First, if you install the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html">Java(TM) Web Services Developer Pack 1.2</a>
in the <code>lib/endorsed</code> directory of your Java Runtime Environment (JRE).&nbsp;
The file <code>xsltc.jar</code> contains an old version of BCEL that is incompatible with
FindBugs.&nbsp; Because jar files in the <code>lib/endorsed</code> directory
take precedence over those in the application, there is no easy way to
fix the problem except to remove the offending jar file.&nbsp;
A workaround is to move these Jar files
into a different directory, and use the <code>java.endorsed.dirs</code> system
property to specify the new location for programs that require these files.

<p> The other possibility is that you are using the IBM JDK.&nbsp;
Some versions include a version of BCEL which conflicts with the
one required by FindBugs.&nbsp; This problem is fixed in version 1.4.1 SP1,
so upgrading your JDK should allow FindBugs to run correctly.

<p> Many thanks to Peter Meulmeester for identifying the problem
with the Web Services Developer Pack, and to Michael Levi for reporting
the problem with the IBM JDK.

<h2><a name="q3">Q3: FindBugs is running out of memory, or is taking a long time to finish</a></h2>

<p> In general, FindBugs requires lots of memory and a relatively
fast CPU.  For large applications, 512M or more of heap space may be
required.  By default, FindBugs allocates 256M of heap space.
You can increase this using the <code>-maxHeap <i>n</i></code> option,
where <i>n</i> is the number of megabytes of heap space to allocate.

<p> Version 0.6.9 of FindBugs introduced new types of analysis that
improve precision, but require more memory and time to perform.
In version 0.7.0 and later, you can disable these analyses by
adding the <code>-conserveSpace</code> option to the FindBugs
command line.  E.g.:

<pre>
   findbugs -textui -conserveSpace -xml -project myProject.fb -outputFile out.xml
</pre>

<h2><a name="q4">Q4: What is the "auxiliary classpath"?  Why should I specify it?</a></h2>

<p> Many important facts about a Java class require information about
the classes that it references.&nbsp; For example:
<ul>
<li> What other classes and interfaces the class inherits from
<li> What exceptions can be thrown by methods in external classes
and interfaces
</ul>

<p> The "auxiliary classpath" is a list of Jar files, directories, and
class files containing classes that are <em>used</em> by the code you
want FindBugs to analyze, but should not themselves be analyzed
by FindBugs.

<p> If FindBugs doesn't have complete information about referenced classes,
it will not be able to produce results that are as accurate as possible.&nbsp;
For example, having a complete repository of referenced classes allows
FindBugs to prune control flow information so it can concentrate on
paths through methods that are most likely to be feasible at runtime.&nbsp;
Also, some bug detectors (such as the suspicious reference comparison detector)
rely on being able to perform type inference, which requires complete
type hierarchy information.

<p> For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you completely specify
the auxiliary classpath when you run FindBugs.&nbsp; You can do this
by using the <code>-auxclasspath</code> command line option, or the
"Classpath entries" list in the GUI project editor dialog.

<p> If FindBugs cannot find a class referenced by your application, it
will print out a message when the analysis completes, specifying the
classes that were missing.&nbsp; You should modify the auxiliary classpath
to specify how to find the missing classes, and then run FindBugs again.
