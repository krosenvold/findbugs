<h1>FindBugs FAQ</h1>

<p> This document contains answers to frequently asked questions about
<a href="index.html">FindBugs</a>, a bug pattern detector for Java.

<h2>Q1: I'm getting java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError when I try to run FindBugs</h2>

<p> FindBugs requires JRE 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; If you use an earlier version,
you will see an exception error message similar to the following:
<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
edu/umd/cs/findbugs/gui/FindBugsFrame (Unsupported major.minor version 48.0)
</pre>
The solution is to upgrade to JRE 1.4.0 or later.

<h2>Q2: When I click the "Find Bugs!" button, I get a NoSuchMethodError</h2>

<p> The symptom of this bug is that when you start the FindBugs analysis,
you see an exception similar to the following:
<pre>
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.bcel.Repository.setRepository(Lorg/apache/bcel/util/Repository;)V
        at edu.umd.cs.findbugs.FindBugs.clearRepository(FindBugs.java:483)
        ...
</pre>
The problem here is that the wrong version of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">Apache BCEL</a>
library is being found.&nbsp; The probable cause is that you have installed libraries from
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html">Java(TM) Web Services Developer Pack 1.2</a>
in the <code>lib/endorsed</code> directory of your Java Runtime Environment (JRE).&nbsp;
The file <code>xsltc.jar</code> contains an old version of BCEL that is incompatible with
FindBugs.

<p> Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to this problem, because files in the
<code>lib/endorsed</code> directory take precedence over those those in the
application's CLASSPATH.&nbsp; Therefore, FindBugs will not worked with these
Jar files installed in this way.&nbsp; A workaround is to move these Jar files
into a different directory, and use the <code>java.endorsed.dirs</code> system
property to specify the new location for programs that require these files.

<p> Many thanks to Peter Meulmeester for tracking down the cause of this problem.

<h2>Q3: FindBugs is running out of memory, or is taking a long time to finish</h2>

<p> In general, FindBugs requires lots of memory and a relatively
fast CPU.  For large applications, 512M or more of heap space may be
required.  By default, FindBugs allocates 256M of heap space.
You can increase this using the <code>-maxHeap <i>n</i></code> option,
where <i>n</i> is the number of megabytes of heap space to allocate.

<p> Version 0.6.9 of FindBugs introduced new types of analysis that
improve precision, but require more memory and time to perform.
In version 0.7.0 and later, you can disable these analyses by
adding the <code>-conserveSpace</code> option to the FindBugs
command line.  E.g.:

<pre>
   findbugs -textui -conserveSpace -xml -project myProject.fb -outputFile out.xml
</pre>
