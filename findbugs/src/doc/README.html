<h1>FindBugs - A Bug Pattern Detector for Java</h1>

<p> @RELEASE_DATE@, Version @VERSION@

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p> FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for instances
of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be errors.

<p> This document describes version @VERSION@ of FindBugs.&nbsp; This is a very
early release of the tool, so you should expect to find problems with it.&nbsp; We
are very interested in getting your feedback on FindBugs.&nbsp; Please visit
the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/bugs">FindBugs web page</a> for
the latest information on FindBugs, contact information, and support resources such
as information about the FindBugs mailing lists.

<h2>2. Using FindBugs</h2>

<p> FindBugs has two user interfaces, a graphical interface and a command line
interface.

<h3>2.1 Using the Graphical interface</h3>

<p>To use the graphical interface, execute the command

<pre>
  java -jar $INST_DIR/lib/findbugsGUI.jar
</pre>

where "$INST_DIR" is the directory in which you installed the FindBugs distribution.

<p> To start a new project, choose the "File:New Project" menu option.&nbsp; You will see
a dialog which looks like this:

<p> <img src="project-dialog.png">

<p> Use the "Browse" button next to the "Jar file" text field to select a Jar file
containing java classes to analyze for bugs.&nbsp; You may add multiple Jar files.&nbsp;
Optionally, you can add the source directories which contain the source code for
the Jar files you are analyzing.&nbsp; This will enable FindBugs to highlight the
source code which contains a possible error.

<p> Once you have added all of the Jar files and source directories, click the 
"Find Bugs!" button to analyze the classes contained in the Jar files.&nbsp;
Note that for a very large program on an older computer, this may take quite a while (tens of minutes).&nbsp;
A recent computer with ample memory will typically be able to analyze a large
program in only a few minutes.&nbsp; For example, on a 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 Xeon, we can
analyze the <code>rt.jar</code> file (26 MB) from Sun's JDK 1.4.2-beta in about 6 minutes.&nbsp;
In any case, a dialog will report the progress of the analysis.

<p> When the analysis completes, you will see a screen like the following:

<p> <img src="example.png">

<p> The top pane of the window shows the <em>bug tree</em>; this is a hierarchical representation
of all of the potential bugs detected in the analyzed Jar files.&nbsp; The tabs allow you
to browse by class, package, or bug type.

<p> When you select a particular <em>bug instance</em> in the top pane, you will see a description
of the bug in the "Details" tab of the bottom pane.&nbsp; In addition, the "Source code" tab
of the bottom pane will, for some kinds of bugs, show the program source code when the
potential bug occurs.&nbsp; In the above example, the bug is an access to an uninitialized
field in a constructor.&nbsp; The source code window highlights the line containing the
problematic access.

<p> You may use the "File:Save project" menu option to save the current
lists of Jar files and source directories.&nbsp; A saved project may be loaded
with the "File:Open project" menu option.&nbsp; Note that the analysis results
are not saved, so you will have to run the analysis again.&nbsp; (Saving results
may be added to a future FindBugs release).

<h3>2.2 Using the command line interface</h3>
