<h1><a name="Intro">1. Introduction</a></h1>

<p> FindBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs.  It looks for instances
of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be errors.

<p> This document describes version @VERSION@ of FindBugs.&nbsp; This is an
early release of the tool, so you may find problems with it.&nbsp; We
are very interested in getting your feedback on FindBugs.&nbsp; Please visit
the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/bugs">FindBugs web page</a> for
the latest information on FindBugs, contact information, and support resources such
as information about the FindBugs mailing lists.

<h2>1.1 Requirements</h2>

<p> To use FindBugs, you need a runtime environment compatible with
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">Java 2 Standard Edition</a>, version 1.4 or later.

<h2>1.2 Changes since last version</h2>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.0:
<ul>
<li> Many user interface bugs have been fixed.
<li> Upgraded to a recent CVS version of BCEL, with some bug fixes.&nbsp;
This should prevent FindBugs from crashing when there is a failure to find
a class on the classpath.
<li> Added support for Plastic look and feel from <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/">jgoodies.com</a>.
<li> Major overhaul of infrastructure for doing dataflow analysis.
</ul>

<h2>1.3 Planned features</h2>

<p> Features that are planned for future releases:
<ul>
<li> Better tracking of locks for inconsistent synchronization detector.&nbsp; This
should decrease the number of false positives.
</ul>

<h1><a name="Using">2. Using FindBugs</a></h1>

<p> FindBugs has two user interfaces, a graphical interface and a command line
interface.

<h2>2.1 Using the Graphical interface</h2>

<p>To use the graphical interface, execute the command

<pre>
  java -jar $INST_DIR/lib/findbugsGUI.jar [options...]
</pre>

where "$INST_DIR" is the directory in which you installed the FindBugs distribution.

<h3>2.1.1 Command line options</h3>

<p> Several command line options are available.

<ul>
<li> The <code>-plastic</code> option makes the user interface use the Plastic
look and feel from <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/">jgoodies.com</a>.&nbsp; To use this
option, download the plastic look and feel, and copy the <code>plastic.jar</code>
file into the $INST_DIR/lib directory.&nbsp; The Plastic look and feel more
closely resembles common desktop GUI environments than does Swing's default
Metal look and feel.
<li> The <code>-debug</code> option causes the FindBugs program to print
the names of classes and the analyses being performed to the standard
output descriptor.
</ul>

<h3>2.1.2 Creating a project</h3>

<p> To start a new project, choose the "File:New Project" menu option.&nbsp; You will see
a dialog which looks like this:

<p> <img src="project-dialog.png">

<p> Use the "Browse" button next to the "Jar file" text field to select a Jar file
containing java classes to analyze for bugs.&nbsp; You may add multiple Jar files.&nbsp;
Optionally, you can add the source directories which contain the source code for
the Jar files you are analyzing.&nbsp; This will enable FindBugs to highlight the
source code which contains a possible error.&nbsp; Another optional step is to
add additional Jar files or directories as classpath entries.&nbsp; You should do this
if the Jar files you are analyzing have references to other classes which are not
included in the analyzed jar files and are not in the standard runtime classpath.&nbsp;
Some of the bug pattern detectors in FindBugs make use of class hierarchy information,
so you will get more accurate results if the entire class hierarchy is available
which FindBugs performs its analysis.

<h3>2.1.3 Running the analysis</h3>

<p> Once you have added all of the Jar files and source directories, click the 
"Find Bugs!" button to analyze the classes contained in the Jar files.&nbsp;
Note that for a very large program on an older computer, this may take quite a while (tens of minutes).&nbsp;
A recent computer with ample memory will typically be able to analyze a large
program in only a few minutes.&nbsp; For example, on a 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 Xeon, we can
analyze the <code>rt.jar</code> file (26 MB) from Sun's JDK 1.4.2-beta in about 6 minutes.&nbsp;
In any case, a dialog will report the progress of the analysis.

<h3>2.1.4 Browsing results</h3>

<p> When the analysis completes, you will see a screen like the following:

<p> <img src="example.png">

<p> The top pane of the window shows the <em>bug tree</em>; this is a hierarchical representation
of all of the potential bugs detected in the analyzed Jar files.&nbsp; The tabs allow you
to browse by class, package, or bug type.

<p> When you select a particular <em>bug instance</em> in the top pane, you will see a description
of the bug in the "Details" tab of the bottom pane.&nbsp; In addition, the "Source code" tab
of the bottom pane will, for some kinds of bugs, show the program source code when the
potential bug occurs.&nbsp; In the above example, the bug is an access to an uninitialized
field in a constructor.&nbsp; The source code window highlights the line containing the
problematic access.

<p> You may use the "File:Save project" menu option to save the current
lists of Jar files and source directories.&nbsp; A saved project may be loaded
with the "File:Open project" menu option.&nbsp; Note that the analysis results
are not saved, so you will have to run the analysis again.&nbsp; (Saving results
may be added to a future FindBugs release).

<h2>2.2 Using the command line interface</h2>

<p> To use the command line interface, execute the command

<pre>
  java -jar $INST_DIR/lib/findbugs.jar [-sortByClass] <em>file1.jar</em> <em>file2.jar</em>
</pre>

where "$INST_DIR" is the directory in which you installed FindBugs.&nbsp; You can list any
number of Jar files (or plain class files).&nbsp; The -sortByClass option may be used
to sort the reported bug instances by class name.&nbsp; The results will be sent
to the standard output file descriptor.
