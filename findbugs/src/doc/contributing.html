<h1>Contributing to FindBugs</h1>

<p> If you have a bug fix or feature enhancement you would like to contribute,
we would be happy to consider it for inclusion.&nbsp; The best way to
send an enhancement is to create a diff against the latest code
in the FindBugs CVS repository.&nbsp;  Just run the command <code>cvs diff</code>
from the root of your CVS working directory.&nbsp;
Be sure to use the "-u" or "-c"
option to diff.&nbsp; Instructions for checking out the latest FindBugs
source code can be found on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=96405">project CVS web page</a>.

<p> Note: if you are contributing a new bug detector or an enhancement
to an existing one, please submit a test case that contains an example
of the new kind of bug.
