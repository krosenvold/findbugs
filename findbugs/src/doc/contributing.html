<h1>Contributing to FindBugs</h1>

<p> If you have a bug fix or feature enhancement you would like to contribute,
we would be happy to consider it for inclusion.</p>

<h2>Preparing a patch</h2>

<p> The best way to
send an enhancement is to create a patch against the latest code
in the FindBugs CVS repository.&nbsp;  Just run the command <code>cvs diff</code>
from the root of your CVS working directory and redirect the
output to a file.&nbsp;
Instructions for checking out the latest FindBugs
source code can be found on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=96405">project CVS web page</a>.
</p>

<p> Please follow these guidelines when preparing your patch:</p>
<ul>
<li> Generate the patch using the "-c" or "-u" option to cvs diff.
<li> <b>Use the same indentation style as the source file(s) you
     are modifying</b>.&nbsp; In particular, please use tabs (not spaces)
     to indent your code; one tab per indent level.
<li> If at all possible, avoid making whitespace modifications.
<li> Small patches are appreciated.
<li> If you are submitting a new bug detector, please submit a small
     standalone source file that contains an instance of the
     kind of bug the detector looks for.
<li> If you are modifying the Swing GUI, please use
     <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> to keep the generated
     Java code in sync with the .form files.
</ul>

<p> Following these guidelines makes it much easier for us
to incorporate new code.

<h2>How to submit a patch</h2>

<p> Patches may be submitted through the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=614695&group_id=96405&func=browse">Patches</a> tracker on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/findbugs/">sourceforge project page</a>.
