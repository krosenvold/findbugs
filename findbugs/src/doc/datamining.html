<h1>
Data mining of bugs with FindBugs
</h1>


<p>
FindBugs now incorporates an ability to perform sophisticated queries on bug
databases and track warnings across multiple versions of code being
studied, allowing you to do things such as seen when a bug was first introduced, or to examine
just the warnings that have been introduced since the last release, or to graph the number
of infinite recursive loops in your code over time.

<p>
These techniques all depend upon the XML storage format used by FindBugs for storing warnings.
These XML files usually contain just the warnings from a particular analysis run, but
you can also store the results from analyzing a sequence of software builds or versions

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>
The current tools for FindBugs data mining are designed to be invoked
from the command line.

<p>
Briefly, the commands are:

<dl>
<dt>unionBugs<dd> combine the results from separate analysis of disjoint
		classes
<dt>computeBugHistory<dd> Merge bug warnings from multiple versions into
			a single multiversion bug database. This can either be used
			to add more versions to an existing multiversion database,
			or to create a multiversion database from a sequence of single version
			bug warning databases.
<dt>filterBugs<dd> Select a subset of a bug database
<dt>mineBugHistory<dd> Generate a tabular listing of the number of warnings in each
		version of a multiversion bug database
<dt>defectDensity<dd>
<dt>convertXmlToText<dd> Convert bug warnings in XML format to 
		a textual, one line per bug, format
</dl>

<h3>unionBugs</h3> 
<p>
If you have, for example, seperately analyzing each jar file used in an application,
	you can use this command to combine the seperately generated xml bug warning files into
	a single file containing all of the warnings.
<p>Do <em>not</em> use this command to combine results from analyzing different versions of the same
file; use computeBugHistory instead.

<h3>computeBugHistory</h3>
<p>Use this command to generate a bug database containing information from different builds or versions
	of software you are analyzing.
<h3>filterBugs</h3>
<p>This command is used to select a subset of warnings from a FindBugs XML warning file
and write the selected subset to a new FindBugs warning file.
<p>
This command takes a sequence of options, and either zero, one or two
filenames of findbugs xml bug files on the command line.
<p>If no file names are provided, the command reads from standard input
and writes to standard output. If one file name is provided,
it reads from the file and writes to standard output.
If two file names are provided, it reads from the first and writes the output
to the second file name.
