FindBugs 1.1 demo and results
</h1>

<p>If you just want to try running FindBugs against your
own code, you can run using Java Webstart using either our 
<a href="http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/demo/jnlp/findbugs.jnlp">old gui</a> 
or our <a href="http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/demo/jnlp/findbugs.jnlp">new gui (requires Java 1.5+)</a>.
The new gui provides a number of new features, but hasn't received as much testing and requires Java 1.5+. 
Both use exactly the same analysis engine.

<p>This web page provides results of running FindBugs 1.1
against several open source applications. We provide a summary
of the number of bugs we found, as well as a generated HTML listing
of the bugs and 
a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Java 
WebStart</a> demo of the new GUI we've introduced in FindBugs version 1.1,
displaying the warnings and the relevant source.


<p>The applications and versions of them we report on
are somewhat arbitrary. In some cases, they are release versions,
in other cases nightly builds. We find lots of bugs in every large code
base we examine; these applications are certainly not the worst we have seen.
I have been allowed to confidentially examine the results of running FindBugs
against several closed commercial code bases by well respected companies;
the results I've seen there are not significantly different from
what I've observed in open source code bases. 


<p><em>Experimental details</em>: These results are from running
FindBugs 1.1-rc4 at standard effort level. Our results do not include
any low priority warnings or any warnings about vulnerabilities to 
malicious code. Although we have (repeatedly) manually audited the results,
we haven't manually filtered out false positives from these warnings,
so that you can get a feeling for the quality of the warnings generated
by FindBugs.
<p>In the webstart versions, we've only including the bugs for which
we were able to identify source files. In some cases, the bug counts displayed
on this page and in the HTML pages may reflect compiled classes included in
the binary distribution of the application for which no source is included
in the source distribution. The number of lines of non-commenting source
statements in the table below (KNCSS) is derived from the same files
that we analyzed and in which we report bugs; we actually compute
KNCSS from the classfiles, not the source files.

<p><em>Vulnerability disclosure</em>: Thankfully, Java isn't C or C++. Dereferencing
a null pointer or accessing outside the bounds of an array generates a runtime
exception rather than a shell exploit. We do not believe that any of the
warnings here represents a security vulnerability, although we have not audited
them to verify that. These projects are all aware of the existence of
FindBugs, and  FindBugs is already open source and available
for use both by developers and attackers, we don't believe that making
these results available constitutes a reckless disclosure.


<p><em>Recommendations</em>: First, review the correctness warnings.
Those are the warnings we are most confident in, and we put a <em>lot</em>
of effort in FindBugs 1.1 into finding new real correctness bugs
and reducing the number of false positives. We feel confident that developers
would want to fix most of the high and medium priority warnings we report.
Once you've reviewed those,
you might want to look at some of the other categories. 
<p>
In other categories,
such as Bad practice and Dodgy code, we accept more false positives. You
might decide that a pattern bug pattern isn't relevant for your code
base (e.g.,  you never use Serialization for persistent storage,
so you never  care about the fact that you didn't define a serializationUID),
and even for the bug patterns relevant to your code base,
perhaps only a minority will reflect problems serious enough to
convince you to change your code.

<p><em>Please be patient</em> The Web start  versions not only have to download the applications,
	they need to download about 10 megabytes of data and source files. Please
	be patient. Sorry we don't have a progress bar for the data and source download;
	the ability to remotely download a data and source archive is a little bit of 
	a hack. We've provided small versions of some of the data sets that include
	only the correctness bugs and the source files containing those warnings. The small
	datasets are about a quarter of the sizes of the full datasets.

<h2>Bug categories</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Correctness bug
<dd>Probable bug - an apparent coding mistake
            resulting in code that was probably not what the
            developer intended. We strive for a low false positive rate
<dt>Bad Practice
<dd>
Violations of recommended and essential
            coding practice. Examples include hash code and equals
            problems, cloneable idiom, dropped exceptions,
            serializable problems, and misuse of finalize.
            We strive to make this analysis accurate,
                although some groups may
            not care about some of the bad practices.
<dt>Dodgy
<dd>
Code that is confusing, anomalous, or
            written in a way that that leads itself to errors.
            Examples include dead local stores, switch fall through,
            unconfirmed casts, and redundant null check of value
            known to be null.
            More false positives accepted.
            In previous versions of FindBugs, this category was known as Style.
