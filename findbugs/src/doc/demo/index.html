<h1>
FindBugs 1.1 demo
</h1>

<p>This web page provides results of running FindBugs 1.1
against several open source applications. We provide a summary
of the number of bugs we found, as well as a generated HTML listing
of the bugs and 
a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Java 
WebStart</a> demo of the new GUI we've introduced in FindBugs version 1.1,
displaying the warnings and the relevant source.

<p>The applications and versions of them we report on
are somewhat arbitrary. In some cases, they are release versions,
in other cases nightly builds. We find lots of bugs in every large code
base we examine; these applications are certainly not the worst we have seen.


<p><em>Experimental details</em>: These results are from running
FindBugs 1.1-rc4 at standard effort level. Our results do not include
any low priority warnings or any warnings about vulnerabilities to 
malicious code. Although we have (repeatedly) manually audited the results,
we haven't manually filtered out false positives from these warnings,
so that you can get a feeling for the quality of the warnings generated
by FindBugs.
<p>In the webstart versions, we've only including the bugs for which
we were able to identify source files. In some cases, the bug counts displayed
on this page and in the HTML pages may reflect compiled classes included in
the binary distribution of the application for which no source is included
in the source distribution.

<p><em>Vulnerability disclosure</em>: Thankfully, Java isn't C or C++. Dereferencing
a null pointer or accessing outside the bounds of an array generates a runtime
exception rather than a shell exploit. We do not believe that any of the
warnings here represents a security vulnerability, although we have not audited
them to verify that. These projects are all aware of the existence of
FindBugs, and  FindBugs is already open source and available
for use both by developers and attackers, we don't believe that making
these results available constitutes a reckless disclosure.


<p><em>Recommendations</em>: First, review the correctness warnings.
Those are the warnings we are most confident in, and we put a <em>lot</em>
of effort in FindBugs 1.1 into finding new real correctness bugs
and reducing the number of false positives. We feel confident that developers
would want to fix most of the high and medium priority warnings we report.
Once you've reviewed those,
you might want to look at some of the other categories. 
<p>
In other categories,
such as Bad practice and Dodgy code, we accept more false positives. You
might decide that a pattern bug pattern isn't relevant for your code
base (e.g.,  you never use Serialization for persistent storage,
so you never  care about the fact that you didn't define a serializationUID),
and even for the bug patterns relevant to your code base,
perhaps only a minority will reflect problems serious enough to
convince you to change your code.
