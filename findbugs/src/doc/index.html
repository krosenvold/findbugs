<h1>FindBugs - A Bug Pattern Detector for Java</h1>

<p> This is the web page for FindBugs, a program which looks for bugs
in Java code.&nbsp; It is free software, distributed under the terms
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser GNU Public License</a>.

<p> FindBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; However, it
can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java.

<p> The current version of FindBugs is @VERSION@,
released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

<p> FindBugs is beta quality software.&nbsp; You may find bugs in it,
and the features and source code may change significantly in future releases.&nbsp;
We are very interested in getting feedback on how to improve FindBugs.&nbsp;
Send your comments to <a href="mailto:daveho@cs.umd.edu">daveho@cs.umd.edu</a>.

<h1>News</h1>

<p> We will present an updated version of <i>Finding Bugs is Easy</i>
as part of the Onward! track of
<a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowPage.do?id=Home">OOPSLA 2004</a>.&nbsp;
A <a href="@WEBSITE@/docs/oopsla2004.pdf">draft of the paper</a> is available.

<p> Changes since version 0.8.2:
<ul>

<!-- New detectors -->
<li> New detector to find improperly overridden GUI Adapter classes (Dave Brosius)
<li> New detector to find improperly setup JUnit TestCases (Dave Brosius)
<li> New detector to find variables that mask class level fields (Dave Brosius)
<li> New detector to find comparisions of values computed
     with bitwise operators that always yield the same result
     (Tom Truscott)
<li> New detector to find unsafe getClass().getResource() calls (Bill Pugh)
<li> New detector to find GUI changes not in GUI thread but in static main (Bill Pugh)
<li> New detector to find calls to Collection.toArray() with zero-length
     array argument; it is more efficient to pass an array the size
     of the collection, which can be populated and returned as the result (Dave Brosius)

<!-- Analysis improvements -->
<li> Better suppression of false warnings in various detectors (Bill Pugh, David Hovemeyer)
<li> Enhancement to ReadReturnShouldBeChecked detector for skip() (Dave Brosius)
<li> Enhancement to DumbMethods detector (Dave Brosius)
<li> Open stream detector does not report wrappers of
     streams passed as method parameters (David Hovemeyer)

<!-- Feature enhancements -->
<li> Cancel confirmation dialog in Swing GUI (Pete Angstadt)
<li> Better relative path saving in Project file (Dave Brosius)
<li> Detector Priority in GUI is now saved in prefs file (Dave Brosius)
<li> Controls in GUI to reorder source and classpath entries, and
     ability to flip between Project details and bugs pages (Dave Brosius)
<li> In Swing GUI, analysis error dialog supports "Select All"
     and "Copy" operations for easy generation of error reports
     (Dave Brosius)
<li> Complete translation of bug descriptions and messages
     into Japanese (Hanai Shisei)

<!-- Bug fixes -->
<li> Fixed bug in DroppedException detector (Dave Brosius)

<!-- Development stuff -->
<li> The source distribution defaults to using JDK 1.5 javac
     to compile, but support for compiling with JSR-14 prototype
     is still supported
</ul>
