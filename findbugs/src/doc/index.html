<h1>FindBugs - A Bug Pattern Detector for Java</h1>

<p> This is the web page for FindBugs, a program which looks for bugs
in Java code.&nbsp; It is free software, distributed under the terms
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser GNU Public License</a>.

<p> FindBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; However, it
can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java.

<p> The current version of FindBugs is @VERSION@,
released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

<h1>News</h1>

<p> We will be giving a presentation about using static analysis
to find bugs at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne 2004</a>.&nbsp;
We will also be participating in a FindBugs BOF (Birds of a Feather)
session.&nbsp; Hope to see you there!

<p> Changes since version 0.7.2:

<ul>
<li> Documentation includes an HTML document with descriptions of
     all bug patterns reported by FindBugs
<li> Changed the Inconsistent Synchronization detector so that fields
     synchronized 50% of the time (or more) are reported as
     medium priority bugs (previously they were reported as low)
<!--
<li> Changed CFG construction to distinguish "implicit" unchecked
     exceptions, so analyses such as the Open Stream detector can
     avoid reporting them
-->
<li> New detector to find private methods that are never called
<li> New detector to find suspicious uses of non-short-circuiting boolean
     operators (<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>, rather than
     <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>)
<li> FindBugs web page has a link to a
<a href="http://www.simeji.com/findbugs/doc/manual_ja/index.html">Japanese translation</a>
of the FindBugs manual, contributed by Hiroshi Okugawa
</ul>
