<h1>Changes since last version</h1>

<p> Note that the version number jumped from 0.6.6 to 0.6.9;
there were no 0.6.7 or 0.6.8 releases.

<p> Changes since version 0.6.6:

<ul>
<li> The null pointer dereference detector is more powerful
<li> Significantly improved heuristics and bug fixes in
     inconsistent synchronization detector
<li> Improved heuristics in open stream and dropped exception detectors;
     fewer false positives should be reported
<li> Save HTML summary in XML results files, rather than recomputing;
     this makes loading results in GUI much faster
<li> Report at most one String comparison using == or != per method
<li> The findbugs.bat script on Windows autodetects FINDBUGS_HOME,
     and doesn't open a DOS window when launching the GUI
     (contributed by TJSB)
<li> Emacs reporting format (contributed by David Li)
<li> Various bug fixes
</ul>

<p> <a href="Changes.html">Older versions...</a>
