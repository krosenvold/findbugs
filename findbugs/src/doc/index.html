<h1>FindBugs - A Bug Pattern Detector for Java</h1>

<p> This is the web page for FindBugs, a program which looks for bugs
in Java code.&nbsp; It is free software, distributed under the terms
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser GNU Public License</a>.

<p> FindBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; However, it
can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java.

<p> The current version of FindBugs is @VERSION@,
released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

<p> FindBugs is beta quality software.&nbsp; You may find bugs in it,
and the features and source code may change significantly in future releases.&nbsp;
We are very interested in getting feedback on how to improve FindBugs.&nbsp;
Send your comments to <a href="mailto:daveho@cs.umd.edu">daveho@cs.umd.edu</a>.

<h1>News</h1>

<p> Chris Grindstaff has written a two-part article about FindBugs
(<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-findbug1/">Part 1</a>,
<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-findbug2/">Part 2</a>)
for IBM developerWorks.&nbsp; Thanks, Chris!

<p> We will be giving a presentation about using static analysis
to find bugs at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne 2004</a>.&nbsp;
We will also be participating in a FindBugs BOF (Birds of a Feather)
session.&nbsp; Hope to see you there!

<p> Changes since version 0.7.3:

<ul>
<li> Experimental modification of open stream detector
     to look for non-escaping JDBC resources
     (connections and statements) that aren't
     closed on all paths out of method
<li> Eclipse plugin fixed so it compiles and runs on Eclipse 2.1.x
     (Peter Friese)
<li> Option to Swing GUI and command line to generate project file
     using relative paths for archives, source directories,
     and aux classpath entries (Dave Brosius)
<li> Improvements to findbugs.bat script for launching FindBugs
     on Windows (Dave Brosius)
<li> Updated Japanese message translations (Hiroshi Okugawa)
<li> Added some missing data in the bug messages XML files
<li> Fixed some problems building from source on Windows systems
<li> Various minor bug fixes
</ul>

<!--
<li> Changed CFG construction to distinguish "implicit" unchecked
     exceptions, so analyses such as the Open Stream detector can
     avoid reporting them
-->
