<h1>FindBugs - A Bug Pattern Detector for Java</h1>

<p> This is the web page for FindBugs, a program which looks for bugs
in Java code.&nbsp; It is free software, distributed under the terms
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser GNU Public License</a>.

<p> FindBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; However, it
can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java.

<p> The current version of FindBugs is @VERSION@,
released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

<p> FindBugs is beta quality software.&nbsp; You may find bugs in it,
and the features and source code may change significantly in future releases.&nbsp;
We are very interested in getting feedback on how to improve FindBugs.&nbsp;
Send your comments to <a href="mailto:daveho@cs.umd.edu">daveho@cs.umd.edu</a>.
