<h1>Changes since last version</h1>

<p> Changes since version 0.6.0:

<ul>
<li> New bug pattern detector which looks for places where a
     null pointer might be dereferenced
<li> New bug pattern detector which looks for IO streams that are opened,
     do not escape the method, and are not closed on all paths out of the method
<li> Command line interface can save bugs as XML
<li> GUI can save bugs to and load bugs from XML
<li> An "Annotations" window in the GUI allows the user to add
     textual annotations to bug reports; these annotations are preserved
     when bugs are saved as XML
<li> In this release, the Japanese bug summary translations by
     Germano Leichsenring are really included (they were inadvertently
     omitted in the previous release)
<li> Completely rewrote the control flow graph builder, hopefully
     for the last time
<li> Simplified implementation of control flow graphs, which should reduce
     memory use and possibly improve performance
<li> Improvements to command line interface (list bug priorities, filter by priority,
     specify aux classpath, specify project to analyze)
</ul>
