<h1>FindBugs - A Bug Pattern Detector for Java</h1>

<p> This is the web page for FindBugs, a program which looks for bugs
in Java code.&nbsp; It is free software, distributed under the terms
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser GNU Public License</a>.

<p> FindBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; However, it
can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java.

<p> The current version of FindBugs is @VERSION@,
released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

<p> FindBugs is beta quality software.&nbsp; You may find bugs in it,
and the features and source code may change significantly in future releases.&nbsp;
We are very interested in getting feedback on how to improve FindBugs.&nbsp;
Send your comments to <a href="mailto:daveho@cs.umd.edu">daveho@cs.umd.edu</a>.

<h1>News</h1>

<p> Chris Grindstaff has written a two-part article about FindBugs
(<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-findbug1/">Part 1</a>,
<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-findbug2/">Part 2</a>)
for IBM developerWorks.&nbsp; Thanks, Chris!

<p> We will be giving a presentation about using static analysis
to find bugs at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne 2004</a>.&nbsp;
We will also be participating in a FindBugs BOF (Birds of a Feather)
session.&nbsp; Hope to see you there!

<p> Changes since version 0.8.1:
<ul>
<li> Fixed a critical ClassCastException bug (triggered if the -workHard
     option was used, and an exception type was merged with an
     array type during type inference)
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.8.0:

<ul>
<li> Disabled SwitchFallthrough detector to work around NullPointerExceptions
<li> Added some additional false positive suppression heuristics
</ul>

<p> Also, two contributors to the 0.8.0 release were inadvertently
left out of the credits:

<ul>
<li> Pete Angstadt fixed several problems in the Swing GUI
<li> Francis Lalonde provided a task resource file for the
     FindBugs Ant task
</ul>

<p> Thanks to everyone who has contributed bugfixes and features
to FindBugs!

<p> Changes since version 0.7.4:

<ul>
<li> New detector to look for uses of "+" operator to
     concatenate String objects in a loop (Dave Brosius)
<li> Reference comparision detector looks for places where the
     argument passed to the equals(Object) method isn't the
     same type as the receiver object
<li> Better suppression of false warnings in many detectors
<li> Many improvements to Eclipse plugin (Andrei Loskutov,
     Peter Friese)
<li> Fixed problem with building Eclipse plugin on Windows
     (Thomas Klaeger)
<li> Open stream detector looks for unclosed PreparedStatement
     objects (Thomas Klaeger, Rohan Lloyd)
<li> Fix for open stream detector: it wasn't detecting close() methods
     called through an invokeinterface instruction (Thomas Klaeger)
<li> Refactoring of visitor classes to enforce
     use of accessors for visited class features (Brian Goetz)
</ul>
