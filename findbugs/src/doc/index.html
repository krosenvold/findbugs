<h1>FindBugs - A Bug Pattern Detector for Java</h1>

<p> This is the web page for FindBugs, a program which looks for bugs
in Java code.&nbsp; It is free software, distributed under the terms
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser GNU Public License</a>.

<p> FindBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; However, it
can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java.

<p> The current version of FindBugs is @VERSION@,
released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

<p> FindBugs is beta quality software.&nbsp; You may find bugs in it,
and the features and source code may change significantly in future releases.&nbsp;
We are very interested in getting feedback on how to improve FindBugs.&nbsp;
Send your comments to <a href="mailto:daveho@cs.umd.edu">daveho@cs.umd.edu</a>.

<h1>News</h1>

<p> We will be giving a presentation about using static analysis
to find bugs at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne 2004</a>.&nbsp;
We will also be participating in a FindBugs BOF (Birds of a Feather)
session.&nbsp; Hope to see you there!

<p> Changes since version 0.7.2:

<ul>
<li> Enhanced Eclipse plugin, which displays the detailed bug
     description in a view (Phil Crosby)
<li> Various tweaks to existing detectors to reduce false warnings
<li> New command line option <code>-workHard</code> enables pruning
     of infeasible or unlikely exception edges, which results in
     better accuracy in the open stream detector, at the expense
     of a 30%-100% slowdown
<li> New website and HTML documentation design
<li> Documentation includes an HTML document with descriptions of
     all bug patterns reported by FindBugs
<li> Web page has a link to a
     <a href="http://www.simeji.com/findbugs/doc/manual_ja/index.html">Japanese translation</a>
     of the FindBugs manual, contributed by Hiroshi Okugawa
<li> Changed the Inconsistent Synchronization detector so that fields
     synchronized 50% of the time (or more) are reported as
     medium priority bugs (previously they were reported as low)
<li> New detector to find code that catches IllegalMonitorStateException
<li> New detector to find private methods that are never called
<li> New detector to find suspicious uses of non-short-circuiting boolean
     operators (<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>, rather than
     <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>)
</ul>

<!--
<li> Added some missing data in the bug messages XML files
<li> Experimental modification of open stream detector
     to look for non-escaping JDBC resources
     (connections and statements) that aren't
     closed on all paths out of method
<li> Eclipse plugin fixed so it compiles and runs on Eclipse 2.1.x
     (Peter Friese)
<li> Improvements to findbugs.bat script for launching FindBugs
     on Windows (Dave Brosius)
<li> Updated Japanese message translations (Hiroshi Okugawa)
-->

<!--
<li> Changed CFG construction to distinguish "implicit" unchecked
     exceptions, so analyses such as the Open Stream detector can
     avoid reporting them
-->
