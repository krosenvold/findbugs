<h1>FindBugs&trade; Users</h1>

<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of FindBugs users; as of September 2006, we've had
more than 270,000 downloads. 

<p>FindBugs is used in many companies and organizations. 
We don't have a list of all the users of FindBugs, and we don't have 
permission to identify many of the companies where we know FindBugs is being used
(getting this permission often involves red tape and lawyers). But
here are some statics from Google Analytics showing unique visitors
to the FindBugs web pages for the months of June through August, 2006.
