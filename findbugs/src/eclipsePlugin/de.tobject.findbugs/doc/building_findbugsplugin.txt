Here is how to build the FindBugs Eclipse Plugin:

Install Eclipse
================
1) Download and install Eclipse 2.1.x.
2) Start Eclipse.

Import the projects
====================
3) Choose [File | Import]. The import wizard opens.
4) In the wizard, proceed as follows:
   a) Choose [Existing project into workspace]. Click [Next]
   b) Choose the location where you have placed the plug-in source, e.g. 
      D:\Projects\findbugs-0.7.0-src\src\eclipsePlugin\de.tobject.findbugs
   c) Click [Finish].
5) Repeat steps 3 to 4 for the second project 
   (D:\Projects\findbugs-0.7.0-src\src\eclipsePlugin\edu.umd.cs.findbugs) as well.
   
Make sure the current findbugs.jar is in place
===============================================
6) Copy all JAR files from D:\Projects\findbugs-0.7.0-src\lib to 
   D:\Projects\findbugs-0.7.0-src\src\eclipsePlugin\edu.umd.cs.findbugs.
   Make sure that you copied the file findbugs.jar, which is the FindBugs engine.
   Copy the coreplugin.jar file to 
   D:\Projects\findbugs-0.7.0-src\src\eclipsePlugin\edu.umd.cs.findbugs\plugin.

Compile the plug-ins
=====================
7) In Eclipse, activate the resource perspective.
8) Expand the project [edu.umd.cs.findbugs].
9) Right-click the build.xml file and choose [Run ANT...] from the context menu.
10) From the ANT dialog, select the targets [build.jars] and [zip.plugin].
    Make sure that you select them in THIS PARTICULAR ORDER! You can verify this
    by looking at the field labelled "Target execution order". It must read
    "build.jars, zip.plugin".
11) Click [Run]. You can now watch ANT working in the console view. After a few
    seconds, the console view should print "BUILD SUCCESSFUL".
12) Repeat steps 7 to 11 for the project [de.tobject.findbugs].

When you are done, you will find the files edu.umd.cs.findbugs_0.7.0.zip and 
de.tobject.findbugs_0.0.3.zip in the respective project root folders. For 
information on how to install the compiled plug-ins into Eclipse, please refer
to the document "installing_findbugsplugin.txt".
