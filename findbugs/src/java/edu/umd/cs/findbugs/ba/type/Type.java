/**
 * Interface for objects representing Java types.
 * In general, an Type provides a type
 * for a value used in a Java method.
 * Types of values include:
 * <ul>
 * <li> basic types (BasicType): int, char, short, double, etc.
 * <li> reference types (ReferenceType): includes the type of the null
 *      value (NullType), class and interface types
 *      (ClassType), and array types (ArrayType)
 * <li> special dataflow types: top (TopType) and bottom (BottomType)
 * <li> "extra" types: LongExtraType and DoubleExtraType, which
 *      arise because BCEL thinks that longs and doubles take two
 *      stack slots
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The "" in Type and related classes exists to distinguish
 * them from BCEL's Type class and subclasses. The BCEL Type
 * class and descendents suffer from several shortcomings:
 * <ol>
 * <li> They are not interned, meaning that many objects
 *      may exist representing a single type.
 * <li> BCEL reference types are inconsistent about whether a signature
 *      or class name is used to create them.
 * <li> BCEL's ArrayType class is not a subtype of ObjectType:
 *      this is just wrong, IMO.
 * <li> BCEL has no data structure to represent a class hierarchy:
 *      subtype relationships are discovered by a series of
 *      repository lookups. (This also makes questions like
 *      "what are all of the direct subclasses of this class"
 *      difficult to answer efficiently.)
 * <li> BCEL has no built-in representation for dataflow top and bottom
 *      types.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> The goals of Type and related classes
 * are to be efficient in dataflow analysis, and to make
 * class hierarchy queries flexible and easy.
