<p> A whizzy set of classes for representing Java types.
These have some improvements over BCEL's Type class and
subclasses:
<ul>
<li> array types are a subtype of object types (as they should be)
<li> type classes are designed to use flyweight pattern
     using a factory/repository object
<li> class type objects designed to form inheritance graph
     data structure for quick class hierarchy lookups
     in both directions (up and down)
</ul>
