<p>
A high-level abstraction layer for codebases, classes, and components
of classes (methods, fields, instructions, etc.)&nbsp; The idea is
to decouple FindBugs as much as possible from any particular
bytecode framework (BCEL, ASM, etc.)
</p>

<p>
Implementations of these interfaces may be found in the
edu.umd.cs.findbugs.classfile.impl package.&nbsp; Instances should
be created using the ClassFactory singleton in that package.
