  <h1>Method may expose internal representation by returning array</h1>
  <p> Returning an array value stored in one of the object's fields
  exposes the interal representation of the object.&nbsp; For classes shared
  by other untrusted classes, this could potentially be a security issue.&nbsp;
  Returning a new copy of the array is better approach in many situations.
