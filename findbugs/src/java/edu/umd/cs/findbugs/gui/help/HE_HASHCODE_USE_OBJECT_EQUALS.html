  <h1>Class defines hashCode() and uses Object.equals()</h1>
  <p> This class defines a <code>hashCode()</code> method but inherits its
  <code>equals()</code> method from <code>java.lang.Object</code>
  (which defines equality by comparing object references).&nbsp; Although
  this will probably satisfy the contract that equal objects must have
  equal hashcodes, it is probably not what was indended by overriding
  the <code>hashCode()</code> method.&nbsp; (Overriding <code>hashCode()</code>
  implies that the object's identity is based on criteria more complicated
  than simple reference equality.)
