  <h1>Field should be both final and moved out of an interface and made package protected</h1>
 <p>
	A mutable static field in an interface could be changed by malicious code or
        by accident from another package.
        The field could be made package protected and/or made final 
	to avoid this vulnerability.
        Having mutable state in an interface is confusing, so the field should
        be moved out of the interface.
