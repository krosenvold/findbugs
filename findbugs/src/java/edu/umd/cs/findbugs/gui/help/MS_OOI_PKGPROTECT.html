  <h1>Field should be moved out of an interface and made package protected</h1>
<p>
 A final static field that is 
defined in an interface references a mutable
	object such as an array or hashtable.
	This mutable object could 
	be changed by malicious code or
        by accident from another package.
	So solve this, the field needs to be moved to a class
	and made package protected 
	to avoid
        this vulnerability.
