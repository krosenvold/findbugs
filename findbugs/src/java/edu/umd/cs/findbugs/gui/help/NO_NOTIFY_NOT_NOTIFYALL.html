  <h1>Using notify() rather than notifyAll() in method</h1>
  <p> This method calls <code>notify()</code> rather than <code>notifyAll()</code>.&nbsp;
  Java monitors are often used for multiple conditions.&nbsp; Calling <code>notify()</code>
  only wakes up one thread, meaning that the thread woken up might not be the
  one waiting for the condition that the caller just satisfied.
