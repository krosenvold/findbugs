  <h1>Method ignores results of InputStream.read()</h1>
  <p> This method ignores the return value of one of the variants of
  <code>java.io.InputStream.read()</code> which can return multiple bytes.&nbsp;
  If the return value is not checked, the caller will not be able to correctly
  handle the case where fewer bytes were read than the caller requested.&nbsp;
  This is a particularly insidious kind of bug, because in many programs,
  reads from input streams usually do read the full amount of data requested,
  causing the program to fail only sporadically.
