  <h1>Method explicitly invokes run (did you mean to start it instead?)</h1>
  <p> This method explicitly invokes <code>run()</code> on an object.&nbsp;
  In general, classes implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface because
  they are going to have their <code>run()</code> method invoked in a new thread,
  in which case <code>Thread.start()</code> is the right method to call.
