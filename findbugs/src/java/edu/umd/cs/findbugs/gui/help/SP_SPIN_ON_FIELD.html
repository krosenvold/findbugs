  <h1>Method spins on field</h1>
  <p> This method spins in a loop which reads a field.&nbsp; The compiler
  may legally hoist the read out of the loop, turning the code into an
  infinite loop.&nbsp; The class should be changed so it uses proper
  synchronization (including wait and notify calls).
