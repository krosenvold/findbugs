  <h1>Unsynchronized get method, synchronized set method</h1>
  <p> This class contains similarly-named get and set
  methods where the set method is synchronized and the get method is not.&nbsp;
  This may result in incorrect behavior at runtime, as callers of the get
  method will not necessarily see a consistent state for the object.&nbsp;
  The get method should be made synchronized.
