Here is how to run the FindBugs Eclipse Plugin Tests:

1) If necessary, check out the findbugs and findBugsEclipsePlugin projects.
They are siblings of this project stored in:
http://findbugs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/findbugs
http://findbugs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipsePlugin

2) Add a local.properties file to the root of the findBugsEclipsePlugin project.
This file should contain an entry for the eclipse plugins directory.
For example:

eclipsePlugin.dir=C:/Java/eclipse-rcp-ganymede/plugins 

3) Build the findbugs project.
Select the build.xml file at the root of the findbugs project, Run As, Ant Build.

4) Build the findBugsEclipsePlugin project.
Select the build.xml file at the root of the findbugs project, Run As, Ant Build.

5) Set the target platform.
